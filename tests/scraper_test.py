"""
Tests for main scraper.

This module tests that:
    - Monkeypatched is_textfile() returns True when scraper returns
      well-formed and False otherwise.
    - checksum() method returns correct checksums both using MD5 and SHA-1
      algorithms.
    - checksum() method raises ValueError when illegal algorithm is given.
    - checksum() method raises IOError when checksum calculation is attempted
      for a file that does not exist.
    - empty text files are not well-formed according to the scraper.
    - non-existent files are not well-formed according to the scraper.
    - giving None instead of a file name to the scraper results in successful
      scraping with a result of not well-formed.
    - file type detection without scraping works and respects the predefined
      file type if provided.
    - Character encoding detection works and respects the predefined file type
      if provided.
    - Grading works so that the correct digital preservation grade is returned.
    - Scraper works with undecodable filenames.
    - If a scraper has XML-incompatible characters in its messages or errors,
      they are filtered out correctly.
